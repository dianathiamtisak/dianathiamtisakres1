      <p> I traveled to Taiwan last summer with my family from my mom's side. We had so much fun! <br/>
      Once we landed at the Taiwanese Airport, We were ready to explore! We only had a few days to tour around so we got busy immediatly. <br/> 
      We rushed out and got onto the tour bus as fast as possible so that all 6 of us could sit near each other. <br/>
      We went to so many places, I don't even remember what the places were called... but heres what I can remember! : <br/>
      We ate A LOT of good food!! (like A LOT!!!!!) 
        
      <p> And lots of boba
        
      Our tour guide also took us to musuems like the beautiful National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. This museum was dedicated to the first president of Taiwan (I think).
